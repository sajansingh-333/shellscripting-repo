Redirections in Unix
Before discussing redirections, we need a detailed understanding of the different types of streams in UNIX. 

Normally, UNIX commands take their input from Keyboard and display their output on the terminal. If the command results in error, then the error is also displayed on the terminal. These a called as standard streams in UNIX.

Standard input stream: Keyboard
Standard output stream: Terminal
Standard error stream: Terminal


These standard streams can be changed in UNIX i.r., you can manipulate UNIX to accespt input from a fie instead of keyboard o to store the output and error in a file instead of displaying it on the screen. This is what we call as redictions in UNIX.

Redirections are done with the help of redirection operators in UNIX:

Input redirection operator(<) or (0<)
Output redirection operator(>) or (1>)
Error redirection operator(2>)
Redirections come in handy when you write automation scripts where inputs need to provided through file, outputs and errors need to be stored in a file.
