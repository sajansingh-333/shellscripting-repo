Features of Unix
What makes the Unix operating system special? 
How did it manage to face the challenges posed by its competitors and still be one of the most preferred operating systems for programmers around the world? 
For starters, we can say Unix is simple, in all seriousness. Unix offers both CLI(Command Line Interface) and GUI(Graphical User Interface) to its users. 
Unix has certain standard features that makes it unique and special. Some of them are listed below:

i)  Multi-user: 
Multiple users can login and use the system and share the resources in a Unix machine without compromising the security of one user from the other at the same time.

ii) Multi-tasking: 
Unix can handle multiple tasks at once while sharing the system resources fairly among them. 
Along with managing the active process, it can also effectively handle multiple background processes as well.

iii)Pipes: 
Unix allows you to connect multiple small programs and create a complex program using pipes

iv) Hierarchical File System: 
Unix stores information in a hierarchical file system. This makes it easier to maintain files and folders and other information in the system effectively.
We will learn more about the Unix file system in the upcoming resources.

v)Security: 
A vaild username and password is needed to access a Unix system.

vi) Utilities:
Users can perform various functions in a Unix machines instantly by using the utilities provided by Unix. 
Create a file using ‘touch’, print a statement using ‘echo’ and what not.

vii)  Portability: 
Unix is written in a high-level machine language which makes it easily portable.

viii) Redirections:
Using the redirection features in Unix, one can modify the standard input, output, and error streams of Unix as per the need.

ix) Sofware development tools: 
Unix supports almost all software development tools.
